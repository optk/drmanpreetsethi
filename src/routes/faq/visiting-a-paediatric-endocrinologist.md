Before the patient is shown in to the doctor, the child’s anthropometry is taken in detail. This includes his weight, height and head circumference ( where ever applicable). Heights of both parents are also measured especially if the patient is being shown for short stature. Every child’s Blood Pressure is also checked. Additional measurements such as waist and hip circumference are measured in specific cases like Childhood Obesity. These measurements are then plotted onto a growth chart and handed over to the doctor. 

When in the doctor’s chamber, a detailed history and examination including the genital (and breast for girls) examination would be done in the presence of parents.
