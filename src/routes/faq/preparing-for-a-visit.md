Please carry all previous medical records of the child including those of any past height and weight measurements done at any doctor’s or in the school report card records. Knowledge about the child’s birth weight and other birth details is also very useful. If a child is being seen for short stature, it is ideal for both parents to accompany the child as their heights will also need to be measured. Details of any previous investigations must also be available. 

While visiting the doctor a second time, always remember to carry the growth chart given to you along with the doctor’s prescription.

It is also helpful if the child is dressed in loose and comfortable clothes for the doctor’s visit.
