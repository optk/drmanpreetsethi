The growth chart uses lines to display an average growth path for a child of a certain age, sex, and height. Serial measurements over time are plotted on the growth chart and the trajectory followed over time. Each line indicates a certain percentage of the population that would be that particular height at a particular age. A boy with a height that is plotted on the 25th percentile line, for example, indicates that approximately 25 out of 100 boys his age are shorter than him. Children often do not follow these lines exactly, but most of the time their growth over time is roughly parallel to these lines. A child who has a height plot that is below the 3% line is considered to have short stature compared with the general population. 
We use India specific growth charts in our clinic.
