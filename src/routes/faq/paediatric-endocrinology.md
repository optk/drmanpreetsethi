Pediatric Endocrinology is the branch of pediatrics that deals with all kinds of hormone issues in children. These issues include Type 1 Diabetes where there is a deficiency of the hormone insulin, short stature, pubertal problems like early or delayed puberty to name a few. This branch of pediatrics is highly dependent on the clinicianâ€™s acumen and approach. The doctor in turn also relies a lot on laboratory tests including hormone levels and certain specialized tests and their correct interpretation to reach a diagnosis and plan treatment thereafter.
