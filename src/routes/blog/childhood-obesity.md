### What to expect when a child with obesity is brought to our clinic?
Apart from taking weight and height, the waist circumference, body fat analysis will be done and all plotted onto a graph. A detailed history and examination of the child shall also be done. Then a few investigations, mainly regarding complications of obesity will be ordered.
On the second visit, after reviewing all reports, a thorough counseling session on weight management would be done. Written instructions about dietary and lifestyle changes would be provided. The child is then recalled after one month or three months depending on their convenience.

### What are the goals of weight management in children?
In children <10 years, goal is to prevent further weight gain rather than weight loss over the next 1-2 years. If the weight of the child does not increase and the height keeps increasing, the BMI shall reduce over a period of time. In children >10 years and adolescents, goal is to lose 0.5-2 kg/month.
