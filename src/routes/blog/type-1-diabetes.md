### What is Type 1 Diabetes?
Type 1 Diabetes occurs when the islet cells of the pancreas stop producing insulin. Most often, this happens due to autoimmune antibody mediated destruction of the islet cells in genetically predisposed individuals.

### What is the age of onset of Type 1 Diabetes?
Type 1 Diabetes affects people between the ages of 1 year up to the third decade of life.

### How is Type 1 Diabetes different from Adult Diabetes?
In Adult Diabetes or Type 2 diabetes, there is normal or increased production of insulin to begin with but there is resistance to the action of insulin at tissue level. And therefore, Type 2 Diabetes can be treated with oral drugs that increase the sensitivity of insulin at the tissue level. However, In Type 1 Diabetes, there is NO INSULIN being produced in the body and therefore it has to be managed with Insulin itself.

### What is the most important aspect of management of Type 1 Diabetes?
Acceptance of Diagnosis by parents, parentsâ€™ (and child if older) motivation and keenness to understand and learn about Diabetes is the most important part of Type 1 Diabetes management.

### How is Type 1 Diabetes managed?
The four pillars of Type 1 Diabetes management are

Adhering to the correct diet
Giving Insulin 3-4 times daily as advised by your doctor
Exercise and activity

### Do people diagnosed with TIDM have to stay lifelong on Insulin?
Yes, TIDM requires lifelong treatment with insulin. Very simply put, TIDM is a condition of absolute insulin deficiency and like any other deficiency, it has to be replaced because the body needs it and is just not producing it. 

### How many times a day is Insulin given to a child with TIDM?
The ideal regimen of insulin administration all over the world is the basal-Bolus method where 4 shots of insulin are given: One long acting insulin once a day and 3 shots of short acting insulin before 3 major meals.

### Is there any other way of giving Insulin other than insulin injections?
The treatment of TIDM is insulin only. The mode of insulin delivery can be many such as Injections, pens (with very small needles), insulin pumps, through i-ports etc. Insulin in a nasal spray form has also been evaluated and licensed for use in adults but not yet in children.

### Is there any other way of checking blood glucose other than the glucometer?
Yes, there are a few types of Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) available in India wherein the child is pricked only once in 7-14 days for insertion of a sensor and thereafter sugars can be monitored continuously through reading devices like mobile phones etc.

### What is the target range of blood glucose in TIDM?
We should try to maintain the blood glucose levels between 70-150mg/dl in all cases of IDM.

### What are the complications of Type 1 Diabetes?
TIDM can have short term as well as long term complications if not managed adequately. 
Hypoglycemia, is a common but potentially serious complication of TIDM. Blood glucose levels <70mg/dl define Hypoglycemia. It needs to be treated immediately with glucose. Your doctor will give you a detailed management plan of Diabetes management as well as management of Hypoglycemia.

Long term complications that can occur with long standing poorly treated Diabetes happen due to unchecked glucotoxicity in small, medium and large blood vessels supplying the various parts of the body like eyes, kidneys, gut, skin, muscles, heart etc. These are even more exaggerated in people with high cholesterol and smokers.

### What to expect when a Type 1 diabetes patient visits our clinic?
All Diabetic patients are counseled extensively about Type 1 diabetes and its management. There are 3 counseling sessions spread over one week. All patients are given written information about all aspects of diabetes management including diet, insulin, exercise, complications, useful websites etc. 
Patients are also added onto an exclusive whatsapp group of TIDM where they can exchange ideas, new patients can get encouragement from the existing ones.
