### What is Hirsutism?
Hirsutism is excessive growth of "male" pattern of thick, coarse hair that appear on the face, back, chest, abdomen, and thighs in women.
 
### What are the causes of Hirsutism?
In Â¾ cases, Hirsutism is caused by an underlying underlying endocrine disorder called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition where a woman has more male hormones than normal. In addition to hirsutism, women with PCOS may have irregular or absent menstrual periods and/or infertility. Acne, obesity, and an increased risk of diabetes are also common in women with PCOS. 
Other uncommon causes include a genetic disorder called NonClassical CAH, ingestion of anabolic steroids or rarely an androgen producing tumor.
 
### How is Hirsutism treated?
Your doctor will first run a few tests to confirm diagnosis and source of excessive androgens and then put you on some oral medications that need to be taken for at least 6 months to one year.
